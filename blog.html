                    <p><strong>Bringing Stories to Life Through Art</strong><br><br>
                    Illustrations in novels have a unique way of breathing life into characters and settings. From delicate pencil sketches to vibrant watercolor artworks, these images offer a deeper connection to the story. They evoke emotions, highlight pivotal moments, and immerse readers in a visual symphony that complements the written word.</p>
                    <p>Sketches often reveal nuances of a character’s personality, attire, or mood that words alone might not convey.
